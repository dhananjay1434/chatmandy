        "Here are three simple exercises to get you started:\n\n1. **Deep Breathing**: Take 5 slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Focus on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of your body.\n2. **Shoulder Rolls**: Roll your shoulders forward and backward in a circular motion. Repeat for 10-15 seconds. This can help release tension and relax your muscles.\n3. **5-4-3-2-1**: Take a moment to notice 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This can help ground you in the present moment.\n\nRemember, it's not about doing these exercises perfectly \u2013 it's about taking small steps to take care of yourself. Would you like to try one of these exercises now?"
